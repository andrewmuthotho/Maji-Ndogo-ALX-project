The Maji Ndogo Water Data Explorer is a data analytics project I completed as part of my data analyst certification. It focuses on transforming a raw dataset of over 60,000 survey records into actionable insights about water access, quality, and infrastructure in the fictional region of Maji Ndogo.

Through SQL and Power BI, I explored, cleaned, and visualized the data to:

Identify and categorize various types of water sources.

Reveal patterns in water access, such as long queue times and high-demand locations.

Detect inconsistencies and pollution markers in the dataset.

Present insights through a clean, interactive dashboard designed for decision-makers and community stakeholders.

This project demonstrates my ability to apply structured query language for data wrangling and use business intelligence tools for storytelling. It reflects a real-world use case where data analytics can support public health, infrastructure planning, and better community outcomes.

It’s been a fun, challenging, and meaningful project—showing how clean data and clear visuals can help solve messy, human problems.
